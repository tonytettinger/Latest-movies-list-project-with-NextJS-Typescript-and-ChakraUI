Jobylon test assignment

Live version:
[Jobylon Application](https://jobylon-test.netlify.app/)

## Additonal info

I chose NextJS with swr because of the ease of routing and options to deal with server side static generation. I included ChakraUI, because I have been experimenting with it recently and I think its useful for getting an application ready quicker - it also enforces some SEO best practices I believe. 

In a production ready app - depending on the situation - maybe I would preferred to use styled components or SCSS, pre-commit hook checks and TypeScript. But it depends on the actual requirements and timeframe.

Further improvements could include: Generate pages for each job, search functionality, filtering listing by company or job type. From the front-end side: Maybe a different presentation (cards) with pagination, better font selection, unique color scheme, more informative error handling. From SEO perspective: SEO checks, performance checks, including schema for search engines.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
